		I prefer <a href="http://www.espn.com" target="_blank">ESPN's</a> website over BuzzFeed’s because it is easy to navigate, functional, and aesthetically pleasing. Initially, the homepage appears chaotic because of the numerous articles, links, and pictures and the sections that divide them as shown in this screenshot.

		Once the user takes a closer look, it becomes easier to understand. The quick links to different parts of the website are on the left, featured articles in the middle, and quick links to articles on the right. There’s also a navigation bar on top that when expanded, allows for efficient access to more specific parts of the website.

        In this screenshot, hovering over the NBA tab will give you a drop-down menu with links to specific teams or articles about different aspects of the league as a whole. This simple layout is easy to remember because of how simple the logic is. If the user still can’t find an article, there’s always the search function on the top right of the navigation bar. 
	   The only errors I see happening come from new users who are still getting used to the way the website is laid out. However, I think that recovery would be relatively quick because of the simple logic that the website uses and the fact that there are no overly complicated features.

		<p>There is also a nice tab under quick links that suggests teams from different sports based on the user’s location. I thought this was a huge plus because I try to create as little accounts as I can when it comes to sites I don’t consider essential (like my bank, or my school, or Netflix). The suggested favorites make the site feel tailored to me even if it doesn’t open on my favorite team’s homepage.

	<h2 id="less-successful">A Less Effective Web Site</h2>	
	    <p>
	    <!-- Replace the default link URL with the one for your chosen site -->
	    The <a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/?utm_term=.tsvjpGBm8#.iiQRgDmQZ" target="_blank">BuzzFeed</a> site is a little more disorganized than the ESPN site despite them both having essentially the same layout.

		<p>The carousel of pictures on top isn’t much of a carousel, you have to click on the pink right arrow to have it move around to the next set of pictures. When you hover on a picture the title appears but other than the title, the user only has a tiny picture to decide whether the article is worth reading. The left section of links is a little better. The user has a picture, a title, and a short summary of the article. Beneath the main article is a couple of quick links to related articles. To the right are more quick links. The user has the BuzzFeed News section with long article titles in small print. Underneath that is the Trending Now section of BuzzFeed’s popular articles.

        After those sections, the website just becomes harder to understand. Articles litter the left side with seemingly no organization whatsoever. 
	   The worst part of the website was its navigation bar.

        The five links in blue are as specific as it gets. More just gives the users more categories without being too specific either. News for example will lead the user to a page exactly like the homepage except that all the articles can be categorized as news. There are no further breakdowns into Politics, Economics, Sports, Wall Street, etc. I’m not sure why there’s no further breakdown when using the search bar to look up ‘sports’ gives me a list of all sports related articles. There’s clearly some organization that isn’t reflected on the front end. Last but not least, the four yellow links to the right most of the navigation bar are all subjective and vague. Literally anything can go under each link. In short, the website is hard and infuriating to navigate, there is no visual appeal, and there is no organization.
