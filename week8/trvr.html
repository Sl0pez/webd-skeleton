            <p class="no-indent, article"><span>T</span>ypically, people go to the movies, the theatre, and stand-up shows to get away from the real world and the real problems that affect them. <a class="a1" href="http://www.trevornoah.com/" target="_blank">Trevor Noah</a>, a South African comic, manages to talk about these real problems while still taking people away from the real world. His recent stand-up special, <a class="a1" href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt6562866/" target="_blank">Afraid of the Dark</a>, exhibits this ability, specifically through one of his opening jokes on crossing the street. Throughout the joke, Noah appeals to the audience’s ethos and uses mild self-deprecating humor, unexpected punchlines, gestures, and accents to keep the audience occupied leading up to funny takes on current issues.
            </p>
            <p class="article">Trevor Noah opens with a joke about how confident New Yorkers are in trusting the stop lights and crossing the street. Noah starts the joke by saying, &quot;You know what fascinates me about New York is how much people trust the traffic lights. I have never seen anything like it.&quot; With a mostly New York based audience, the topic of crossing the street becomes relatable and familiar thus helping Noah develop a rapport with them. He provides the context of the joke by giving a background for his fascination of traffic lights. He explains that Africans use stoplights more as a suggestion than a law, even joking that an African must have traveled the world and come back to Africa and said &lpar;Noah in an authentic African accent&rpar;, &quot;Guys, guys, guys. We need to get traffic lights. Ah?&quot; In his regular voice, &quot;What for?&quot; to which the African replies, &quot;It’s for the intersection. It adds atmosphere.&quot; At this point, the people who haven’t watched Noah are laughing at the sudden break out of the African accent. Audience members who are familiar with Noah are starting to relax and get into the rhythm of the show. After setting the context, Noah jumps back into the joke by sharing a personal anecdote, his own experience of crossing the street in New York City&colon;
            </p>
            <blockquote>
                I’m walking next to this man. I’ll never forget this. We’re standing there on the sidewalk and the light changes in our favor. And I look to the side and there was this truck that is barreling down the road. And I’m looking at the truck. And as soon as the light changes, the guy next to me, he steps out into the road. Instinctively, I stuck my hand out to protect him. I was like, &quot;Yo dude, there’s a truck.&quot; And he was like, &quot;It’s ok. We’ve got the light.&quot;
            </blockquote>
            <p class="no-indent, article">And in typical Trevor Noah fashion, the last part is said with a stereotypically American accent. At the same time, he turns around in a smooth 180, back straight, legs in a small lunge, arm outstretched, and finger pointing to the light, in what can only be described as the most patriotic way to point at a traffic light. He goes on to detail how that American changed his life as far as trusting traffic lights. They walked the next few blocks together with Noah becoming more and more confident until he could cross the road on his own, with confidence, and full trust in the light. Noah ends the joke by saying, &quot;I&apos;ve come to realize, in America, if you get the white man on your side you can do whatever you like.&quot; The triple entendre that Noah employs through his reference to the white man who walked beside him, the white man of the traffic light, and the white man as a symbol of white supremacy is his commentary of society. The key part of this bit isn’t that the punchline seemingly came out of nowhere, nor is it the creativity of the wording. It is the set-up where Noah starts with the mundane topic of crossing the street then includes a white man walking beside him and stereotypes him using his accents and gestures. That sets up the stage for the punchline without giving away the nature of the joke. Thus, the audience can enjoy the ride away from the real world while still being entertained by Noah’s takes on current issues.
            </p>
            <p class="article">Noah uses mild self-deprecating humor extensively especially with the jokes about his African background and his inability to cross the street. The type of humor in a milder form is a breath of fresh air compared to how most comedians use it. The milder form of humor also restricts the ability to take offense of any of the jokes Noah makes. This part of his comedic style is crucial because it allows Noah to make the comments he does on current issues such as his punchline and its reference to racism in the US. This isn’t only true for his &apos;crossing the street&apos; joke, at least two more of his major bits throughout the show comment on sexism and colonialism. Noah talks about how women can use Russian accents to scare of unwarranted advances, and how the British can’t complain about immigrants when they used to be the first immigrants, invading countries and colonizing them. These otherwise controversial subjects are softened by Noah’s mild humor. Instead of tackling the subject head on, much like his &apos;crossing the street&apos; bit, Noah connects it to personal experiences, show its effect on him. The fact that he does not take the easy way out by spewing wild, general statements about sexism or colonialism set Noah apart from other comedians who use that abrupt and loud type of humor to cut their workload and jump straight into the laughter. Noah&apos;s careful set ups and delivery, while requiring more work, are effective in drawing attention to white supremacy in the case of his &apos;crossing the street&apos; bit to a mostly white audience from a half black man without someone standing up and protesting his performance. 
            </p>
            <p class="article">The gestures Trevor Noah uses, in the pose he strikes when he plays the American helping him cross the street and the other poses he uses help illustrate the jokes and emphasize the points he’s trying to make. A comic on stage, unmoving, spitting out jokes leaves little room for error and relies heavily on comedic content, delivery, and timing. Noah&apos;s use of his body helps widen that metaphorical room and as a result, makes his jokes funnier. The patriotic pose he does to emphasize the American comforting him and telling him to trust the light, is a good example of this. On top of the American accent he uses, the pose strengthens the image of the stereotypical American he portrays. In strengthening that stereotype, Noah&apos;s pose also comments on how Americans are perceived and in doing so, communicates his thoughts on Americans, specifically white Americans. It also doesn’t hurt that it helps deliver the punchline of that joke. Throughout the show, Noah integrates his body in some way or another in each of his main jokes. In the &apos;Russian accent and women&apos; joke, he imitates a couple spooning with the guy behind trying to get his partner to have sex and the girl, too tired to do anything, tries to fend him off until she finally busts out the Russian accent, scaring his penis into submission. Noah bends his body to imitate each couple spooning as he goes from character to character going into detail with the girl&apos;s tired halfhearted attempts to fend off the guy&apos;s increasing horniness and frustration. Finally, he imitates the guy&apos;s penis as it shrivels simply by going into a squat and covering his head with his hands while apologizing and blaming the guy for the situation. The added imagery helps deliver the joke and at the same time becomes a way for Noah to show the audience how tiring it can be to be a woman, through the cowering girl who finally stands up and the horny guy who gets frustrated and takes it out on her. Through this bit, Noah joins the ongoing conversation on feminism not so much to add his two cents but more so to bring attention to it, using his stage in every sense of the word, to get people other people involved. 
            </p>
            <p class="article">On top of his gestures, the authentic accents add another dimension to his jokes, the hyperbolic American, Russian, Indian, and British accents among others helps portray the stereotypical characters that he plays. His American accent, much like his American pose, oozes patriotism and self-righteousness. Noah uses a deep baritone full of self-confidence, enunciating each word carefully, to exaggerate the typical American accent. In doing so, Noah brings to light the power of accents &lpar;something he talks about later in a bit specific to accents&rpar; by enabling the audience to compare the amount of confidence in his American accent versus his own normal accent or his African accent in his &apos;crossing the street&apos; bit. This becomes more apparent in his joke on colonialism. Playing a British and Indian stereotypes, Noah takes the audience on a journey through Britain&apos;s conquest of India and how it really went down. The power of accents becomes more obvious when the British soldier tries to convince the Indian man that they are being conquered but is thrown off by the Indian&apos;s naiveté and nonchalance. While a lesser known issue, the imbalance in the power an accent holds relates directly to colonialism and racism, two big current issues. 
            </p>
            <p class="article">It can be argued that Noah is not trying to give a take or draw attention to current issues for some greater good but merely using the topics as a stepping stone, as something the public is familiar with, to build his jokes from. However, the extent to which Noah goes to set up his jokes as well as the gesture and accents included in the set up that often support his opinions would beg to differ. It is understandable that his counterargument would arise given society’s views on comedians as people who make money at others’ expense. But, Noah is part of a group of forward looking comedians &lpar;Chris Rock, Aziz Ansari, Amy Schumer &lpar;to some extent&rpar;, etc.&rpar; who use their stage as, well, a stage to rally people around and make them aware of current issues. In addition, Noah’s work as a talk show host who touches on many political issues serves as further evidence that he is indeed, commenting on political issues and not just trying to get people to laugh. 
            </p>
            <p class="article">Through Noah’s rapport and appeal to the audience&apos;s ethos, he is able to paint himself as a credible figure that the audience can trust. His mild use of self-deprecating humor is crucial to soften a &apos;political blowback&apos; as it sets up for his punchlines that show his opinions on current events. The unexpected punchlines such as the triple entendre he had in his &apos;crossing the sidewalk&apos; joke, helps soften the political implications even further. The accents and gestures, while subtly supporting and strengthening those opinions, keep the audience engaged as Noah sets up his punchline, using humor as a commentary on contemporary issues.
