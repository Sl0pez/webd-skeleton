            <p>I want to be able to show how it feels to be on different substances, but unlike other infographics or videos, I want to be able to show the whole trip, from the high to the comedown. To do this, I'll use effects that are triggered by the hover function. Hovering on an image of alcohol for example will cause the screen to glow a little then progressively get blurry until the screen turns blindingly white. I also want the background to be in constant motion so that the website has a running theme of being a little disorienting. When people click on the images it will lead them to external website with information about the drug, its side effects, and what to do or who to call when things get out of hand.</p>
            <p>I don't plan on leaving a lot of text instruction on the site itself so users can experiment and discover the website on their own.</p>
