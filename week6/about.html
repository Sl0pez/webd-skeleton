            <p>This is me. Happy as I'll ever be because I'm sitting on seats I can barely afford, watching my favorite team lose to a less than mediocre team. I'm a student at the New School in my sophomore year working towards a Journalism &plus; Design major at Eugene Lang College of Liberal Arts. I'm interested in changing the way we receive news, I think we can go further than visuals and text especially with the emergence of technology like Virtual Reality. I'm also really interested in design insofar as it relates to journalism and web design. I'm discovering a new passion for coding and building websites and it's something I definitely want to pursue in the near future.
