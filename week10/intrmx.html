            <p class="article">NEW YORK – <a href="http://www.intermixonline.com/" class="a1">Intermix</a>, a luxury contemporary women’s clothing store, partnered with the Council of Fashion Designers of America’s (CFDA) fashion incubator to showcase seven young designers in their Meatpacking District store.</p>
            <p class="article">On display were ALIX, Brother Vellies, Haerfest, Haus Alkire, Ji Oh, K/LLER Collection, and Yestadt Millinery. While each brand has its own aesthetic, they are all based in New York and produce their merchandise sustainably. </p>
            <p class="article">Many brands have been working towards sustainable fashion practices, especially throughout the manufacturing process. Intermix is an example of a medium-to-large brand following suit, capitalizing on New York Fashion Week. As a specialty retailer without a private label of its, Intermix focuses on ensuring the designers behind the merchandise they carry stand for something ethical and meaningful.</p>
            <p class="article">From the <a href="https://cfda.com/news/intermix-cfda-celebrate-incubator-pop-up" class="a1">CFDA article</a> on the event, Intermix president Jyothi Rao was quoted on saying, “We’re known for being one of the first retailers to take a risk on emerging talent. This is a wonderful way for us to continue that tradition, which is such a part of our DNA.” On display were ALIX, Brother Vellies, Haerfest, Haus Alkire, Ji Oh, K/LLER Collection, and Yestadt Millinery. While each brand has its own unique aesthetic and purpose they are all brought together by New York, the area in which all of them are based, and all but one sustainably produces their products locally and/or domestically . This relationship is evident in the way the Intermix’s “Retail Lab” was set up.</p>

            </figure>
            <p class="article">In the center are two iPads with headphones for curious shoppers who want to know more about the designers and their work. Around the center piece are the different brands, each with a single rack to display no more than 10 separate items.</p>
            <p>Among the brands present were, <a href="http://alixnyc.com" class="a1">ALIX</a> by Alexandra Alvarez, specializing in bodysuits and representing “basic ideals of sportif sensibility and understated edginess,” <a href="https://brothervellies.com/" class="a1">Brother Vellies</a> displaying African inspired platform heels, loafers, and boots made from Kudu leather in Africa, designed by founder, Aurora James, and <a href="https://haerfest.com/" class="a1">Haerfest</a> (pronounced “harvest”) brining leather bags with “aesthetic, essence, and utility” to the scene designed by brother Timothy and Daniel Joo.</p>
            <p class="article">Intermix’s collaboration with the CFDA might be a risky move in an industry where experience is like currency. However, it is precisely this notion of newness and innovation, together with conscious and sustainable design, that fuel the fashion industry today. Intermix prides itself on upholding these ideals through this thoughtful curation of pieces from seven emerging designers just in time for New York Fashion Week.</p>
