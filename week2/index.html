            <h2 id="purpose"> Purpose of the Site</h2>
            <p>
                The primary purpose of this site is to create a platform where I can display my coding skills and journalistic work so that future employers can find me. The secondary purpose of this site is for me to be able to experiment with different web design concepts and code.
            </p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2 id="audience">Intended Audience</h2>
            <p>
                The intended audience are future employees as well as peers I can work and collaborate with.
            </p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2 id="tone">Tone of the Site</h2>
            <p>
                I want the site to have a casual tone that is not too casual to the point that it is colloquial. It needs to be in the area between uptight/formal and colloquial.
            </p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2 id="primary">Primary Content</h2>
            <p>
                Primary content will be the articles I've written. I'll divide them into different categories such as Sports, Humor, Politics, etc.
            </p>
            <p>
                The homepage will have a horizontal navbar towards the top with links to the different categories of articles. Each link will lead the user to a page with a list of my articles for the appropriate category. Something like this&#58;
            </p>
            <figure>
                <img class="RefImage1" src="Pictures/wireframe1.jpg" alt="Example of a Homepage" width="500">
            </figure>
            <p>
                The list will be set up in such a way that the links to each article will contain a relevant picture &lpar;if available&rpar;, a headline, and a short one-liner summary of the article. Like this ESPN example&#58;
            </p>
            <figure>
                <img class="RefImage1" src="Pictures/espn.png" alt="Example from ESPN" width="500">
            </figure>
            <p>
                Each page including the article pages themselves will have the same navbar from the homepage. The only difference is that there will be an indicator telling the user what category they're currently in. On the top left of each article page there will also be a breadcrumb trail.
            </p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2 id="secondary">Secondary Content</h2>
            <p>
                Secondary content will include an About Me page with a short bio and a Contact Me page with my relevant contact information.
            </p>
            <p>
                The About Me page will be straightforward with a short bio in the center of the page and possibly a picture of myself. The Contact Me page will be similarly minimalist with a link to my email address.
            </p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2 id="navigation">Site Navigation</h2>
            <p>
                My site navigation should look something like this&#58;
            </p>
            <figure>
                <img class="RefImage1" src="Pictures/TreeDiagram.jpg" alt="Tree Diagram" width="500">
            </figure>
            <p>
                At the homepage users will have the option to go to each of the six links including the two links that lead to secondary content. From the four links that lead to primary content, the user will be directed to a page with a list of corresponding articles. Clicking on one of those articles will lead to another page where the article will be displayed in full. From each page displayed in this tree diagram, the user can go to any of the six links including the homepage.
