            <h3>Dear 5-year-old me,</h3>
            <p class="article">5 years old. The naked days. Why do you enjoy being naked so much? You find a chance to do everything naked. You even run out of the shower, dripping wet right into the kitchen where everyone is cooking. You managed to pick the most dangerous rooms in the house to run in. I think your parents are starting to worry that your brain is shrinking from the number of falls and mishaps that happen to you. You don’t just enjoy being naked though. You also fell in love with chocolate-- that sweet, delicious, dark substance that you aren’t allowed to have. You can’t have chocolate after 6pm and even then, you can only have a piece a day. It was classic Romeo and Juliet. You sneak out at night, naked of course, and meet your lover over the wall that was the refrigerator’s drawer. I must commend your morality. You don’t care whether it is black or white, or thick or thin. You love it all equally. You also love the thrill of it almost as much as you love chocolate. The adrenaline rush of quietly opening the door, half sprinting to the fridge, the wind on your balls, the light that illuminates your face when you pull open the drawer, and of course, the sweet satisfaction of tasting your reward. You are a messed-up kid. Everyone has the right to be weird and unique, but boy did you abuse that right.</p>
            
            <h3>Dear 7-year-old me,</h3>
            <p class="article">The period of trying to understand girls. Hating them and loving them at the same time. The period that starts at 7 lasts until the moment you die. Let’s start simple, girls do not have cooties. You don’t get a girl by being mean to her. At least not when you don’t have anything to make up for it. You aren’t tall, dark, and handsome. You are short, pudgy, and in need of a shower. You don’t have a powerful bike that causes mini earthquakes when you rev it up. You have a plastic three-wheeler that you raced right into the pool. You don’t have a bachelor pad that overlooks Central Park. You have a 3-foot-tall bed that overlooks your mess of a room. Let’s be honest, you struggle to climb unto that bed every night, so much so that you choose to keep that bed until this very day to show it that you eventually fucking won. Be nicer to the girls, god knows you could use some help on your homework.</p>

            <h3>Dear 10-year-old me,</h3>
            <p class="article">The awkward boner days. I feel you. You have it good with your tiny boners. You can tuck it into your waistband or just wear tight underwear. But, whenever someone who looks remotely like a girl walks by, boom goes the dynamite. A little self-control is a good thing to learn. Don’t worry, it still happens from time to time. Every man experiences it, you aren’t alone. In fact, you shouldn’t hide it. You should be proud. Not because of its size because we both know it’s a centimeter longer than a pimple, but because it works, a dysfunctional dick is every man’s nightmare. Point is, it doesn’t get better but you get better at hiding it. Hang in there. </p>

            <h3>Dear 12-year-old me,</h3>
            <p class="article">Why do you wear your cap sideways? There are only two acceptable ways, forwards and backwards. Your shoes do not need to be big enough to resemble a pair of tugboats. You do not have to wear long basketball shorts with oversized plain white shirts. Thank god you don’t wear gold chains, you are too Asian to pull it off. You are the most embarrassing version of ourselves. Did you think you are bigger than you are? I just can’t understand why you choose to dress yourself in overly large clothes. That must be traumatic to not just myself but your friends too. Ever wonder why people also walked ahead or behind you in public? You shouldn’t try to be so cool.</p>

            <h3>Dear 15-year-old me,</h3>
            <p class="article">High school is fun, isn’t it? No don’t lie. It’s boring as hell. Basketball is fun, your friends are fun, some of the classes are fun. But Filipino drama makes everything feel like a telenovela. Do you really need to participate in that? You aren’t a smooth handsome Spanish dude. We went over this already. I know you enjoy gossip. And that’s fine but would it kill you to talk about ‘manly’ stuff to save face? There is gossip in the NBA. Better yet there is gossip in the NFL. Men touching, rubbing up, and hitting each other, if that isn’t manly than I don’t know what is. But no, you have to know who went out with whom, who made out with that quiet dude in whose house, and who passed out drunk where. You shouldn’t try to fit in with that party crowd--one shot of sake and you’re gone. SMH. We should both do better.</p>

            <h3>Dear 17-year-old me,</h3>
            <p class="article">Applying for college huh? You think you’re such a big shot to have made it this far? You think college will be your great escape from high school? Just wait until you get those acceptance letters back. Let’s just say that there’s not a whole lot of acceptance in them. Let me motivate you to study harder by giving you a glimpse into the future. Your top choice is going to be The New School. Who names their university ‘The New School?’ Your chocolate loving ass sure isn’t going to get into colleges just based on your looks. Fix your grades. Get smarter. I need to learn how to build a time machine to come back there and whoop your ass. You really fucked it up.</p>

            <h3>Dear 19-year-old me,</h3>
            <p class="article">Well, here we are. You are the product of billions of years of evolution, thousands of years’ worth of knowledge in you, and 19 years of personal evolution. All your mistakes, your hard work, and the blood, sweat, and tears lead up to this version of yourself. You should not have written this letter. Not even your mom thinks you’re funny. </p>
